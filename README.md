# AddreesBookSystem
1. Create a Contact class to represent individual contacts. Include attributes such as name, phone
number, email address, and any other relevant details.
2. Implement an AddressBook class to manage the collection of contacts. Include methods to add a contact, remove a contact, search for a contact, and display all contacts.
3. Design the user interface for the Address Book System. This can be a console-based interface or a
graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
4. Implement methods to read and write contact data to a storage medium, such as a file or a database.
5. Allow users to interact with the Address Book System by providing options such as adding a new
contact, editing an existing contact's information, searching for a contact, displaying all contacts, and
exiting the application. 
6. Implement input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the contact
data is in the correct format.
